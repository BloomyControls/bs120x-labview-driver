The really useful stuff
General Settings:
Mode (CAN / Ethernet)                = Configuration Files/General Settings.xml >> Protocol

Ethernet Settings:
IP Address                           = System Configuration API
TCP (Command) Port                   = Configuration Files/TCP Settings.xml >> Port
TCP (Command) Read Interval (ms)     = Configuration Files/TCP Settings.xml >> Loop Delay RT ms
UDP (Reporting) Port                 = Configuration Files/UDP Settings.xml >> Port
UDP (Reporting) Write Interval (ms)  = Configuration Files/UDP Settings.xml >> Loop Delay RT ms

CAN Settings:
Box ID                               = Data/BS1200 Configuration >> CAN_Settings.box_ID
Write Interval (ms)                  = Data/BS1200 Configuration >> CAN_Settings.write_period_ms **it's actually microseconds
